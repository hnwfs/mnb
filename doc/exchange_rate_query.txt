1 WEB SERVICE FOR EXCHANGE RATES

The service includes two main components:

1.
Interface accessible through the Web (Arfolyamok.asmx). This is (being
a .NET based service) a simple text file that defines the component to
which the external incoming service requests will be forwarded.

2.
Service component (MNBArfolyamok.dll). This component is responsible
for completion of tasks concerning exchange rates in the MNB system
with regard to public requests, exchange rate updates and Web service.

1.1   Data inputs and outputs

For the sake of simplicity, all input and output data are strings:
All outputs are strings, that are source codes of an XML document.
Remark: the format of the date-type values in the outputs is ISO 8601:
without time and time zone (YYYY-MM-DD, e.g.: "2015-04-07").

2  METHODS

The service provides three methods, two of them are interrogating
methods and one is an informative method. For developers of
applications connecting to the service, we recommend to interrogate
the GetInfo method first, and based on this, the application receives
sufficient data for building up correct queries.

2.1   GetInfo
    Input: none.
    Output: string.

Task: To provide information on retrievable data.
Returns the time interval available for query and lists the currency
names available for query. Excerpt from the returned XML on 16-07-2014:

<MNBExhangeRatesQueryValues>
  <FirstDate>1949-01-03</FirstDate>
  <LastDate>2015-07-16</LastDate>
  <Currencies>

  </Currencies>
</MNBExhangeRatesQueryValues>

2.2 GetCurrentExchangeRates
    Input: none.
    Output: string.

Task: Returns the exchange rate table of the last day’s quotation.
The data include only the currencies quoted on the particular day.

2.3 GetExchangeRates
    Input: startDate string, endDate string, currencyNames string.
    Output: string.

Task: Returns the exchange rate table according to the delivered
parameters. It is advisable to specify the dates in form of
year-month-day (separated by hyphens or dots), the currency names
should be specified by their abbreviated three-letter names
(capital letters), separated by commas. Example for requesting a
query:

GetExchangeRates=("2014-07-14", "2014-07-16", "RUB,SGD");

Result of the above request: 

<MNBExchangeRates>
    <Day date="2015-04-14">
        <Rate curr="RUB" unit="1">5,4</Rate>
        <Rate curr="SGD" unit="1">206,04</Rate>
    </Day>
    <Day date="2015-04-15">
        <Rate curr="RUB" unit="1">5,54</Rate>
        <Rate curr="SGD" unit="1">205,61</Rate>
    </Day>
    <Day date="2015-04-16">
        <Rate curr="RUB" unit="1">5,67</Rate>
        <Rate curr="SGD" unit="1">208,49</Rate>
    </Day>
    <Day date="2015-04-17">
        <Rate curr="RUB" unit="1">5,51</Rate>
        <Rate curr="SGD" unit="1">207,62</Rate>
    </Day>
</MNBExchangeRates>

If input data are incorrect, two cases are possible: the resulting
document is empty, or the resulting document includes an error message.
The document is empty, if:

-[ There was no quotation for the requested currencies in the specified time interval.
-[ The value of startDate is later than endDate.
-[ Currency names are incorrect.

An error message appears if any date is incorrect:

<MNBExchangeRates>
    <Error>Invalid startDate</Error>
</MNBExchangeRates>

Or

<MNBExchangeRates>
    <Error>Invalid endDate</Error>
</MNBExchangeRates>

If the Web service is operating but the data source is unavailable
for some reasons, the following message appears:

<MNBExchangeRates>
    <Error>"The server is not available</Error>
</MNBExchangeRates>
